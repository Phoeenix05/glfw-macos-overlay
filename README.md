# GLFW MacOS overlay

An overlay example for MacOS using GLFW. 

I always wondered how stuff like Discord's voice overlay (not available on macos) and Raycast's confetti command and other stuff drew graphics on the screen without a window. This example is meant to show how something like that can be achieved.
